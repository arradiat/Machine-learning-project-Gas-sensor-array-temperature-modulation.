# Machine-learning-project-Gas-sensor-array-temperature-modulation.
We worked on the dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gas+sensor+array+temperature+modulation  which contains about 4 millions observations of the response of 14 Mox gaz sensor when exposed to differents concentrations of carbon monoxide(CO), humidity, temparatures, heat voltage and flow rate. The dataset is presented in 13 text files, where each file corresponds to a different measurement day. The experiment was to study the response of the sensors to different stimulis. So they wanted to determine which sensors should be trusted by comparing their response to different concentrations. So we are going to study the response of thoses sensors.
